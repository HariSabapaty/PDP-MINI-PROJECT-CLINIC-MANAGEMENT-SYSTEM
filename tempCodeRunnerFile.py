A small clinic wants to develop a system to manage their out-patients. The receptionist
should be able to retrieve a patient record (with just the basic information) or create a
new record when a new patient visits for the first time. The receptionist should be able 
to assign patients to available doctors based on the nature of the problem and manage the 
queues. A doctor should be able to view the complete history of a patient and enter current 
diagnosis and prescriptions. The system should then generate an invoice and track the 
payments
